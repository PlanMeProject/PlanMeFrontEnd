# PlanMeFrontEnd

This is the frontend application for PlanMe, an assignments management and planning tool. It is built using ReactJS and provides an intuitive interface for managing your projects.

Prerequisites
Before you can run this application, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Node.js is the runtime environment required to run a React application, and npm is used to manage the project's dependencies.

To check if you have `Node.js` installed, run this command in your terminal:
```
node -v
```

To confirm that you have `npm` installed you can run this command in your terminal:
```
npm -v
```
If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can download and install them from the Node.js official website. This will install both Node.js and npm.


### Installation and Running the Application
Clone the repository to your local machine (if you haven't already):
```
git clone https://github.com/PlanMeProject/PlanMeFrontEnd.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd frontend
```
Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the application:
```
npm start
```
After running these commands, the application should be up and running on your local server, typically at http://localhost:3000.
